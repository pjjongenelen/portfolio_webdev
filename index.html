    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm a data scientist that's dabbling in the world of web development.
      I want to learn more about this because I encounter quite a lot of it in
      my professional life.
    </p>
    <p>
      A coworker tipped me on a Udemy course, so here I am, trying that out.

      This page is me forfeiting some privacy, but then again all this info is
      on LinkedIn anyway...

    <h2>Educational background</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Joint master in Data Science and Entrepreneurship</li>
      <li>Bachelor of Innovation Sciences (Psychology & ICT)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Work experience</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>(May 2022 - present) Data Scientist @ Van Spaendonck Development</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>
      I'm quite familiar with <b>Python</b> and <b>R</b> for data science. Also
      I've recently taken up some <b>ASP .NET</b> at work. Regarding soft
      skills, I'm pretty good at <b>public speaking</b> on AI, data science, and
      other tech related stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to set the bar high, for myself and for others. Because of that,
      you can call me any time you want to get <b>critical feedback</b> on an
      idea or some of your code. I won't spare you. This is also the reason I
      tend to use Hellmo as my profile pic on work related sites. But, as one of
      my favorite professors used to state in his Twitter bio: I'm much nicer in
      real life :)

    <h2>Certificates and Achievements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I have a published conference paper on social network analysis <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData62323.2024.10825561">(IEEE link).</a></li>
            <li>Cambridge English Certificate of Proficiency in English, C2 (2015)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Areas of further interest</h2>
    <p>
      What interests me beyond these work-specific skills are
      <b>philosophy</b> and <b>endurance sports</b>. Hit me up if you want to
      discuss some deontological dilemma's, or if you want to run a marathon. I
      also like to keep up to date with what's going on in the world and am sort
      of a <b>history</b> geek. According to some legends, I was once even a
      history major! If you want to know more about that boring side of me,
