    <h2>Discourses and Selected Writings - Epictetus</h2>
    <p>My love for this book is threefold:
        <ol>
            <li><i>It's a fun read!</i> The way the text is written makes it a pleasure to go through, even though it is quite a lengthy text, and it gets repetitive at some point. I very much liked how the reader is addressed quite frequently in a way that really makes you feel like he sees through you. An example of this is that Epictetus is explaining (to the reader) why it is an absolute waste of time to just read this book in order to get an idea of his philosophical ideas. I think at one point he literally calls you an idiot if you're reading it for that puprose, rather than applying his principles in your life.</li>
            <li><i>The philosophy is actually good.</i>I have found (like many before me) that Stoic philosophy provides you with a very useful framework for approaching some of the more difficult things in life. In short, it really boosts your ability to put things into perspective. "Is this thing that is happening (to me) really either good or bad?"</li>
            <li><i>Epictetus is one of the OG's of self-help books.</i>I've read quite some self-help/management theory books, and the philosophy outlined in this book is at the core of most of them. To think that some of the concepts that modern-day management gurus are pitching have already been around and well-known for thousands of years... Jeez, maybe I should write one of them some day! Of course, the Socratic dialogue writing style isn't for everybody, and the text can be quite theological. But if you're able to see through that, here's the Stephen R. Covey of the 2nd century AD!</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People - Stephen R. Covey</h2>
    <p>This book is the only self-help book you will ever need. Covey focuses on character rather than personality. Meaning that he advocates actually living a purposeful and principled life, rather than giving you some tricks to fake your way through it. I've found that most of the self-help/management books I've read since are either a thinned-down version of the Seven Habits, or they fall into the category of personality tricks (I'm looking at you Michael Bungay Stanier...).</p>
